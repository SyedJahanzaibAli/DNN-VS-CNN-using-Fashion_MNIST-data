**Title: A Comparative Study of Fashion Item Classification Using Sequential Models and Convolutional Neural Networks**

**Introduction:**

In the realm of computer vision and machine learning, image classification serves as a foundational task with widespread applications. In this project, we delve into the domain of fashion item classification, a task crucial for e-commerce, inventory management, and automated tagging systems.

The dataset under scrutiny is the Fashion MNIST dataset, a benchmark collection of grayscale images depicting 10 different fashion categories, including shirts, trousers, dresses, and footwear. With 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, this dataset presents an ideal playground for exploring various classification techniques.

Two primary approaches are investigated in this study: a traditional Sequential Model and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The Sequential Model represents a simple yet effective baseline, while the CNN, renowned for its prowess in handling image data, offers a more sophisticated alternative.

Through this comparative analysis, we aim to elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach concerning accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability. By scrutinizing their performance metrics and training dynamics, we seek to provide insights into the suitability of these models for fashion item classification tasks.

This project not only serves as a practical exploration of machine learning techniques but also contributes to the ongoing discourse surrounding the efficacy of sequential models versus CNNs in image classification tasks, thus aiding practitioners and researchers in making informed decisions when approaching similar challenges.
